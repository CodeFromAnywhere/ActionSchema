Goal: Make it run directly in the browser, hosted on Vercel, served in the browser.

- 1 endpoint: cors-proxy
- IndexedDB can store the data for the user

Ideally, it works with OpenAPIs from big things like OpenAI. Potentially, this can function as the main demo on ActionSchema.com, and we can make this Open Source without open sourcing the stateless or hosted one.

NB: The idea is for this to be used for any frontend.
