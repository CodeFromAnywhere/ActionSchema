`actionschema` will be my new source of truth for `CapableJsonSchema` and `OpenAPIDocument`.

It'd be great to nerd out on this a little, and try making a full actionschema rewrite... It'd be fun and refreshing, just what I need! It might also turn out to become much more powerful...

# TODO ActionSchema 2.0

- âœ… Add VSCode Monaco Editor on the left panel: Color highlighting and JSON-Schema adherence!
- Add `getStoreItem(databaseId,key)` to browser implementation
- Add `fetchPlugin` doing the plugin-call properly
- `execute`: Support `JSON-Schema.default:[]` and `JSON-schema.examples:[]` and demonstrate this with a simple example
- `setDatabaseValue` Implement options. This is crucial for and should be well thought-through before deciding on it.
- Create a test ActionSchema that uses some simple APIs and builds up a JSON from the start.
- Make `>` button reset data and `executeBrowser({dotLocation:""})` so it does it from the start, without data. Its important that `executeBrowser` has a callback to refresh the right editor, every time an update in the data takes place.

After I have this basic setup in which I can run any OpenAPI through my localhost, the goal would be to get it to a point it works with all the requirements.

target:

- âœ… Deploy `actionschema` as npm package named `actionschema` and at `https://github.com/CodeFromAnywhere/ActionSchema`
- Deploy `actionschema-web` on Vercel at `demo.actionschema.com`

After implementation, I can try to implement it doing OpenAPI enrichment, creating an OpenAPI proxy for any OpenAPI, and evaluate the different endpoints.

ðŸ¤¯ An OpenAPI file could be all thats needed for deploying an ultra-scalable server + website + pricing... Everything. My entire day could be spent reorganising Openapis, together with AI. No more coding.
